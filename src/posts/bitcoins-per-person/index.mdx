There will only ever be 21,000,000 Bitcoin in existence.

Meanwhile, world population has exploded over the last century and is projected to reach 10 billion by 2056.

Today there are `18,709,443.75` bitcoins that have been created.

The current world population is `7,865,539,032`.

That means that today, if bitcoins were evenly distrubuted, each person would have `0.00238` bitcoins.

I like to do these calculations occasionally to maintain some perspective on where we stand in bitcoin adoption.
