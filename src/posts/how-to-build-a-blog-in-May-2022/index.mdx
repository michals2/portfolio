I recently built a blog for my wife: [curatingcures.com](https://www.curatingcures.com/).

When deciding how to build it I considered many apprioaches:

- Use a WYSIWYG like SquareSpace or Webflow
- Use a blog specific generator like ghost
- Build something from scratch

I decided to build it myself. I enjoy web development and I haven't built a blog since this site.

My main requirements were:

- She should be able to log into a CMS-like portal and edit content
- It should be free (or very inexpensive) for us to operate
- It should be mobile friendly

Here's the technology stack that I went with (and was very happy with!).

- Remix
- Tailwind
- DaisyUI (with theme cupcake)
- DatoCMS
- Deployed with Vercel

It's a work in progress but I'm proud of how it's come together!
