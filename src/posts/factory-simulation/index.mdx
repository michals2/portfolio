I studied mechanical engineering in college then I worked Boeing's Satelliete Development Center in El Segundo for 5 years. I left Boeing in 2017 to pursue software development but my intention was always to get back into manufacturing through manufacturing software.

I created [this application](https://hadrian-console-web-demo.vercel.app/models/factory-3) to demonstrate how a next-gen factory sumulation tool might look like.

My main inspiration for this project are:

- The AWS Console
- VS Code/GitHub
