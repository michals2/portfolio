## Abstract

I saw a cool website background once and I want to try and recreate it.

## Inspiration

I could have sworn that I saw this background on the datadog homepage. It's no longer there and I can't find it in the waybackmachine. Oh well.

It kind of looked like the following image ([source](https://lovepik.com/image-401531739/tech-blue-low-polygon-mesh-background.html)), but each point was undulating up and down.

## Recreation

### Step 1: Triangle

I LOVE [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) for projects like this. It gives you all of the 3D power of [three.js](https://threejs.org/) with the ease of use and performance benefits of [react](https://reactjs.org/).

Step 1 was to create a triangle. I also added some controls (pan, rotate, zoom) and grid helper.

### Step 2: Wave Motion
