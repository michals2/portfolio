The beginning of my engineering career was in Mechanical Engineering. Now I work in web development. I think the manufacturing industry has a lot to learn from modern web development.

I created [this application](https://four-stroke-engine.vercel.app/) to see how far I can take this concept.

It uses some cool technologies:

- three.js
- react-three-fiber
- Remix
- Tailwind

Currently the manufacturing software industry is dominated by desktop based applications (Creo, AutoCAD, NX, etc).

The future of manufacturing is web based.
