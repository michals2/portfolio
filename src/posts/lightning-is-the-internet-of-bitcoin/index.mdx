## Context

I was listening to a [podcast](https://saifedean.com/podcast/89-disrupting-the-global-payments-industry-with-jack-mallers/) where @jackmallers referred to lightning network as the internet of bitcoin.

The Internet of Bitcoin

I wanted to see if I could explain it to make sure I fully understood it.

## The Internet Protocol

From [britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/protocol-computer-science):

> protocol, in computer science, a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers

The modern internet is built on top the protocol TCP/IP.

from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite)

> The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is the set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks.

- Someone came up with a standard (in this case TCP/IP) by which different computers can communicate
- There were many other competing protocols but this one won out
- The modern internet is built on top of these protocols
- If these protocols were to disappear, the modern internet would disappear

## Bitcoin is a Protocol

Bitcoin is really just a set of rules. Here's a few of them.

- There will never be more than 21M bitcoin
- I own bitcoin if I have a private key (256 bit secret number) to a wallet with bitcoin in it
- New bitcoins are created using computers that expend large amounts of electricity

## Lightning is Built on top of Bitcoin

Lightning is built on top of Bitcoin. 

It makes it cheap, fast and simple to send payments across borders.

This will enable a generation of entrepeneurs to build applications that weren't possible.

That's why it's the internet of Bitcoin.
