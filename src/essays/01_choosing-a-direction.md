## Problem

I struggle to choose one direction and stick with it. I know this is not a problem unique to myself, but it's something I _really_ want to fix.

The main categories I keep bouncing between are:

- Frontend web development (My current day job)
- Data visualization
- 3D software
- Decentralization/Encryption
- Machine learning/Data science
- Finance

---

## Conclusions

- Any one of these is interesting enough to devote one's professional life to. The important thing is to choose one and stick with it.
- Do as much as possible to leverage past experiences
  - Frontend web development (3 years experience)
  - 3D CAD software (5 years experience)
